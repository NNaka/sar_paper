We present a new iterative algorithm that holds promise of being a robust estimator and corrector for arbitrary phase errors. Our algorithm is similar in many respects to speckle processing methods currently used in optical astronomy. We demonstrate its ability to focus scenes containing large amounts of phase error regardless of the phase-error structure or its source. The algorithm works extremely well in both high and low signal-to-clutter conditions without human intervention.},
