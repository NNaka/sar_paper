# GPU Accelerated Entropy Minimization for 3D SAR Images

This paper template requires pdflatex (a version of LaTeX that
generates PDF directly). Any modern Linux system should have
everything installed that you need. The bacchus has all of the
relevant software installed.

The Makefile here is used to compile the paper into 'sar_paper.pdf'.
It requires GNU make, so you may need to type 'gmake'. 

Note: Adopted from Mark Hempstead, who adopted from Matt Welsh at Harvard and
the offical ACM conference paper templates.
