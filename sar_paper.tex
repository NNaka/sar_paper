\subsection*{Abstract}
\begin{small}
This is a template for a paper for Advanced Computer Architecture using PDFLaTeX.
This is supposed to be the abstract, but as you can see, it doesn't
have a lot of content. In the abstract you should summerize the problem, your approach, and results. I have created a makefile for you, simply type \texttt{make} at the terminal to compile.
\end{small}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%  BODY OF PAPER GOES HERE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Generally you will want to break the paper into separate sections
% and use \input{...} to include them, like so:
%\input{intro.tex} 
%\input{motivation.tex}
%\input{design.tex}
%\input{implementation.tex}
%\input{evaluation.tex}
%\input{conclusion.tex}

\section{Introduction}

Some text for the introduction would go here.
It is important that your paper be well-written, as if you were to
submit it to a conference. 

The first sentence of each paragraph should summarize what the
paragraph is about. I usually write by sketching the outline of the
paper and then writing one or two poorly-formed sentences that capture
what each paragraph is going to say. Then I go through the paper and
rewrite each paragraph, one at a time, until it sounds right.
The sketch document is very useful for helping you see where you are
going next, and organizing your thoughts before crafting the actual
sentences.


Here is an example of how to cite various papers, books, and so
forth~\cite{nesc-pldi03,shewchuk-delaunay}.


\section{Project Description}

Use a section or two to describe your project motivation, goals, research approach or proposed solution to the problem. The Section headings should be appropriate for the material dicussed by the paper. Think of some of the section headings in the papers we read. For example:
\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Transactional Memory } this was Section 2 in the Transactional Memory Paper. Using a heading like this conveyed to the reader that this is a new, and important concept.

\item \textbf{Telsa Archiecture} in the \textit{Telsa} paper this section provided the overview of the architecture. \small{(Notice how I'm showing you how to change font styles in \LaTeX{}.)}

\end{itemize} 

\subsection{Specific Detail}

Subsections are very useful for providing structure and making it easy for the reader to follow your dense material. Think about some of the example You might want to include a figure or diagram describing the system, project, or approach.


\section{Experimental Methodology}

Use this section to describe all of the details of your equipment, simulator, CAD tools, or compiler. This is where you list the versions of the tools you used and the configurations. For architecture simulations I recommend including a table with all of the architecture configurations. Then refer the table: Table~\ref{tab:cpu_configs} describes the different architecture parameters that we tested, this is a very complicated table using multicolumn to merge certain collums. For a simple example see Table~\ref{tab:bm} in Section~\ref{sec:results} that provides a summary of our results by benchmark.

\begin{table}[t]

\section{Results and Analysis}
\label{sec:results}  %labels are useful if you want to be able to refer to sections in other places in the text.

In this section you should describe your results and analyze the data. Do not just point to the figure. Explain the data and tell the reader something interesting about the results. If you can say anything interesting then show another figure.

Here is an example of how to include a figure 
(see Figure~\ref{fig-knearest-perf}). You can use PDF, JPEG, 
or PNG files as figures. If you have a PostScript or EPS file, use
{\tt epstopdf} to convert it to PDF first. Generally it is a bad idea
to use bitmap graphics, since they don't look good on screen or in
print. 

% Use 't' to put the figure at the top of the page. This is going to
% look a little strange on the one-page template file, but works fine
% with a multi-page paper.
% The 0.8\hsize directive makes a figure that is 80% of the collumn width.
%
% Note if you need your figure to span both collumns use \begin{figure*} and \end{figure*} instead.
\begin{figure}[t]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.8\hsize]{./figures/reduce.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{{\small {\bf Reduction yield and overhead in the 
$k$-nearest neighborhood region.} {\em This figure shows the average 
yield (fraction of neighbors responding to a reduction request) and
number of messages for reduction operations. The yield and overhead 
are directly related to the number of retransmission attempts made by 
the transport layer.}}}

Sometimes it is better to show data with a table. Table~\ref{tab:bm} provides an example. Notice here we have included all of the miss rates and then bolded the benchmarks that we found interesting and that we are going to explain in the text.



\section{Conclusion}

In this section you should summerize the problem and your results. The conclusion section often contains a paragraph at the end that describes future work and leaves the reader with a good impression of the papers contributions. \textit{Real researchers use \LaTeX{}!}
