\section{Results}\label{sec:Results}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Include system specs e.g. ``implemented on a Tesla
    C1060 GPU with 4 Gbyte of main memory, on an Intel i7 host
    processor with 8 Gbyte of memory, running a 64 bit Linux
    operating system. The Cuda toolkit that was used was version
    3.5.'' (~\cite{gpu-sar})
  \item Comparing performance between brute force, Matlab, C++, and CUDA implementations
    \subitem Graph of performance as a function of input size (see below)
    \subitem Graph of performance as a function of noise (to be generated)
    \subitem Graph of C++ performance as a function of threads (to be generated)
  \item Note the performance difference that almost exponentially grows with number of pulses
\end{itemize}
