\section{Results}\label{sec:Results}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Comparing performance between brute force, Matlab, C++, and CUDA implementations
    \subitem Graph of performance as a function of input size (see below)
    \subitem Graph of performance as a function of noise (to be generated)
    \subitem Graph of C++ performance as a function of threads (to be generated)
  \item Note the performance difference that almost exponentially grows with number of pulses
\end{itemize}
