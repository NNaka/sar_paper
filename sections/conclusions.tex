\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}

The optimised CUDA and C++ implementations for gradient descent are promising
in light of the need for more efficient methods of SAR image post-processing.
Both solutions we propose were found to be robust to varying degrees of noise,
and, barring memory constraints on the GPU, they scale efficiently with the
size of the pulse history through parallelizing computations and applying the
advantages of GPU and CPU architectures.
