\section{Related Work}\label{sec:relatedwork}

SAR image processing is a computationally burdensome task. Many researches have
developed techniques to optimize both image formation and autofocus techniques.
In particular, many papers have been written exploring optimizations to the
image formation technique~\cite{yegulalp1999fast, hartley, liu, clemente, fasih, jin,
park2013efficient}. Many use GPUs or multiple cores to achieve better
performance. Significantly less work has been done on autofocus techniques.
Passerone \textit{et al.} propose a CUDA based GPU implementation of two
autofocus algorithms, Range-Doppler and $\omega$-k with promising
results~\cite{gpu-sar}. Other work, such as~\cite{less_mem_high_eff_autofocus},
uses less of the image to obtain phase estimates. This reduces time and space
complexity but at the cost of efficacy. This work continues in the direction set
by~\cite{gpu-sar} by applying parallel architectures to a different autofocus
technique: gradient descent.
