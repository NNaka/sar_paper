\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

\begin{itemize}
  \item SAR images are used in applications
  \item Due to inherent errors, autofocus is often used to produce clearer images
  \item Efficient algorithms based on PGA have been developed (citation) but for some applications these methods are insufficient
  \item Ash (citation) details a gradient descent algorithm which, while much more computationally complex, can yield better results
  \item Ian and Colin generalized this technique to three dimensional SAR images but have major performance bottlenecks
  \item Their work used a brute force algorithm which, while effective, was very complex, slow, and implemented in MATLAB
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Contributions}

\begin{itemize}
  \item This work contributes two parallel algorithms for minimizing image entropy as a function of the image pulse history
  \item C++ multithreaded implementation (on CPU)
  \item CUDA implementation (on GPU)
\end{itemize}
