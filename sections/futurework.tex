\begin{itemize}
  \item Requires large amounts of RAM (10s to 100s of GB)  as algorithm must keep entire pulse history in memory
    \subitem Could map disk and focus the pulse history partially for memory constrained systems
  \item Memory requirements could also be reduced by pre-selecting a representative portion of the image and autofocusing only the subset
  \item Add support for multiple GPUs (fairly straightforward)
  \item Explore OpenMP and thread pooling to avoid overhead of thread spawning
\end{itemize}
