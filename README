This is a paper template for ECEC-622. It has the correct formatting as
expected for the course. Your final paper should be between 10 and 12 
pages in this format (including *all* text, figures, references, etc.)

This paper template requires pdflatex (a version of LaTeX that
generates PDF directly). Any modern Linux system should have
everything installed that you need. The bacchus has all of the
relevant software installed.

The Makefile here is used to compile the paper into 'template.pdf'.
It requires GNU make, so you may need to type 'gmake'.
